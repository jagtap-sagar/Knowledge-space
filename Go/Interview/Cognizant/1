=>1. Misusing defer
Problem: Incorrect use of defer for resource cleanup, like closing files or connections in loops, causing resource exhaustion.
for _, file := range files {
    f, err := os.Open(file)
    defer f.Close() // Defers until function ends, not loop iteration
}
2.Ignoring Error Handling
Problem: Go requires explicit error handling, but developers sometimes ignore errors, assuming operations always succeed.
file, _ := os.Open("file.txt") // Ignoring error
Impact: Missed errors can lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
Solution: Always check errors explicitly.
