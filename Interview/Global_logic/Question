1. class has char * ptr data member, Write default, parameterized,copy construct ,assignment, move constructor, move assignment.
=> *** I did mistake forgot destructor which lead to memory leak.
2. trace the o/p
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	char * ptr = "Sagar";
	ptr[3] = 'd';
	printf("%s\n",ptr);
}
=> segmation fault, why ?=> not allocating memory to ptr.  "Sagar" is in data segment which tempory created const variable, here we tried
to accesss const pointer.
3. correct code without allocating memory & no new temporary variables.
=>  instead pointer used array
int main()
{
	char  ptr[] = "Sagar";
	ptr[3] = 'd';
	printf("%s\n",ptr);
}
4. What is memory layout in RAM ? tell us sequnces of segment.
5. Where is environment variables in memory segment?
6.  what diff between c & c++?
7. What pointer & reefercnce ?
