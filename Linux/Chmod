chmod 755 filename

7 - 1st decimal for owner

5 - 2nd decimal for group

5  - 3rd decimal for other

In Linux there are 3 permission , Read(r) , write(w), execute(x)  

for read(r) - value is 4 , similarly Write(w) is 2, Execute(x) 1.  

See above example    chmod 755   filename 

1. 7 -    rwx  -> 4+2+1 ->owner

2. 5 -    r-x  ->4+0+1  -> group

3.5 -    r-x ->4+0+1  -> others.

Now similarly  other example  chmod 777 filename  -  4+2+1 = 7 , it has rwx permission to owner, group, others.
