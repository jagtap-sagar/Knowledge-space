Which of the following are equivalent to O(N)? Why?
1.O(N + P), where P < X/2
2. 0(2N)
3.O(N + log N)
4.O(N + M)
=>
Let's go through these.
1.If P < X/2, then we know that N is the dominant term so we can drop the 0( P).
answer is O(n)
2 0(2N) is O(N) since we drop constants.
3. O(N) dominant ,so we drop log N) ,so answer is O(N) 
4. There is no established relationship between N and M, so we have to keep both variables in there.
so answer is O(N)
