10. find size of array without sizeof operator?

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int A[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
    int size = *(&A+1)-A;//(char *)(&A+1) -(char *) (&A);
    cout<<"Size="<<size;
    cout<<"\n Sizeof="<<(char *)(&A+1)-(char *)(&A);
    return 0;
}
Initialize the elements of the array.
   &a => This is the pointer to array which points at the same memory address as a.
   &a + 1 => It points at the address after the end of the array.
   *(a+1) => Dereferencing to *(&a + 1) gives the address after the end of the last element.
   *(a+1)-a => Subtract the pointer to the first element to get the length of the array.
   Print the size.
